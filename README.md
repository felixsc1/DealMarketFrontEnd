# Crypto Deals Market - Front-End

A simple dApp built with React/Next.js and moralis. For the corresponding smart contract, see [this github repo](https://github.com/felixsc1/auticonDealContract).

The dApp allows a trusted third party (e.g. a lawyer) to create, view and manage "deals" on the smart contract using a simple input form.
Customers can pay to the escrow system via the dApp by signing in with their wallet.
